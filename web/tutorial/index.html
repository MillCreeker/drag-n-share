                This service is only intended for sharing data quick and easily.
                It is – by design – not intended for permanent storage of any kind.
                Just a simple way to share files or text, the most straight forward way there is.
                <br>
                No registration, no fees, no limitations in frequency.

            <p>
                Just drag and drop the file(s) you want into the drop area.
                You can upload up to 4 files, with a maximum size of 1 GB.
                Alternatively, you can also you the “Upload” button to do so.
                <br>
                <br>
                On the next screen, give your data a unique name.
                On the next screen, you can add more files using the “+” or click on a file to delete it.
                <br>
                <br>
                When you’re finished, just press “Go” and you’re done on this device.
                Follow the instruction below on your other device to access your files from there.
            </p>

                Click on “Access Data” and search for the name you just gave your uploaded data.
                Enter the access key displayed on your other device (where you uploaded your files) and click on “Access Data” again.
                <br>
                <br>
                You can now download all your files at once with the button “Download all”.
                Alternatively, you can download files individually by clicking on them.

                <br>
                <br>

            <h2 id="unlock-data">My data is locked</h2>
            <img src="../vid/lock_data.gif" alt="Locking Data" loading="lazy" class="tutorial-gif">
            <p>
                For security reasons, your data will be safely locked, when someone tries to access it with the wrong key.
                That’s no issue at all, though.
                <br>
                Just follow the instructions below …
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <img src="../vid/refresh.gif" alt="Refresh" loading="lazy" class="tutorial-gif">
            <p>
                On the device that displays the access key, click on “More Options”.
                This will give you access to additional features.
                <br>
                <br>
                For this scenario, just press the &circlearrowleft; button.
                This will generate a new access key for your data, which should work on other devices now.
                The data is no longer locked.
                <br>
                <br>
                Other options you gain here, are the “Delete” button, which deletes your data on the server permanently.
                <br>
                You can also change the name of your data now.
                If someone continuously tries to gain access to your data (and thereby, keeps locking it), it is recommended to change the name.
                With this, the third party will have to guess the name again, and will not be able to lock it further.
